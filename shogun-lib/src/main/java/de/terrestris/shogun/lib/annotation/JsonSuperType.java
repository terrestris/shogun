/**
 * The `JsonSuperType` annotation helps to identify a type that should be deserialized instead of a parent type.
 * The `type` property specifies the parent type. This annotation needs to go along with a `JsonDeserialize` pointing
 * to the own type.
 * If the super type that should get replaced is already used by another parent, and it should be overridden by another
 * type, then `override` needs to be set to `true`.
